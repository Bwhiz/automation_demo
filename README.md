# automation_demo

This demonstrates a script to clean and get results from an Excel worksheet native to a particular company.
Worked with Python's pandas and streamlit for the app interface.

Like I mentioned earlier , it was built with a department for a particular company in mind.
I am testing the (share.streamlit.io) platform for public apps, that's why I made this repo.
The app is shown [here](https://share.streamlit.io/bwhiz/automation_demo/main/flutter_app.py)
